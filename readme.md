# 🛠️ weDev — Launch Web3 Projects with Zero Friction

**weDev** is an open-source toolkit that lets anyone launch fully customizable microdApps on the Algorand blockchain — no backend, no smart contract experience needed.

Built during the Castell D’Code Retreat with support from the Algorand Foundation and powered by AlgoKit 3.0, weDev enables creators to deploy DAOs, staking modules, and more in just a few clicks. Everything runs through a decentralized registry contract — making the experience fully trustless and developer-free by default.

Led by **Arthur Rabelo** (Web3 Engineer) and **Kieran Nelson** (Senior Web3 Engineer), the project combines deep blockchain engineering with clean and intuitive user experience.
